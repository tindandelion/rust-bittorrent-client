# BitTorrent Client in Rust 

As I [continue my programming adventures in Rust][first-rust-project], I've decided to launch yet another learning project. This time, it's going to be an implementation of a [simple BitTorrent client][project-github]. 

### Motivations

Why BitTorrent? One reason is that I've always been interested in how peer-to-peer systems work. There's something very intriguing about how multiple actors can collaborate to accomplish a task without the need for centralized control. By diving deeper into the implementation of such a system, I hope to gain a better understanding of how they work in general. 

Another reason is that I expect a project like this will help me deepen my experience with Rust. In particular, I would like to become more familiar with these areas that I haven't explored yet: 

* Network programming
* Multi-threaded programming
* Programming console UIs

### Project scope 

Writing a fully-fledged BitTorrent client is quite a big task, so for my pet project I'd like to scale it down to the essentials. I will consider the project accomplished when my solution is able to do the following: 

* Connect to the torrent tracker to fetch the initial information about the file to download
* Download the file from multiple peers in parallel
* Serve requests from other peers while the download is ongoing
* Show the download progress in some form of text-based UI

### Project blog

Like in my [previous project][first-rust-project], I've decided to document my journey in a form of a [project diary][project-blog].
